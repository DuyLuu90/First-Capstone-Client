# Drama-PEDIA

This is my first full stack capstone which demonstrates my mastery of React, Node and PostgresSQL. For this capstone, I built both the client and the API to support the app. Inspired by many awesome online movie websites, i created dramaPEDIA to allow users to view a variety of Films/TV Series from many countries around the world. For user convenience, my app has features to sort movies by genres, year and country of origin.

## Built with:
* React
* Javascript
* HTML5, JQuery, CSS
