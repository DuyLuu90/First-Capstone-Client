# Drama-PEDIA

This is my first full stack capstone, as a junior Developer, to demonstrate my mastery of React, Node and PostgresSQL, . For this capstone, I built both the client and the API to support the app. Inspired by many awesome online movie websites, my app allows users to see a variety of Films/TV Series from many countries around the world. For user convenience, my app has feature to sort them by genres, year and country of origin.

## Built with:
* React
* Javascript
* HTML5, JQuery, CSS

## App Features:

### For general visitors: 
* Movie details, user pages (created by other registered users) and artist pages(created by admin)
* Hide and report comments/reviews from other users to page admin.
* Form validations (for registration)
### For registered users:
*Post, edit, delete, rate (upvote,downvote) reviews for a movie
*Edit personal information (from their User Page)
*Data protection: bcrypt
*Username recovery/password reset
### For page admin:
*Create,edit, delete data
*Publish/unpublish a movie
*Block/unblock a user
*Delete users reviews.
